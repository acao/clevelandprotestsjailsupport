                            <h4>What is a Legal Observer?</h4>
                            <p>A legal observer is a person who observes, monitors and documents law enforcement behavior towards demonstrators during protests and other actions. Legal observers may serve as witnesses to law enforcement misconduct or serve as a deterrent to unconstitutional behavior by law enforcement.</p>

                            <h4>Do I need to be a lawyer to become a Legal Observer?</h4>
                            <p>Not at all - people of wide ranging abilities and skill sets can do this work. The legal observer program is open to everyone willing to be trained and directed by NLG attorneys. <em>Except those working for or with government or law enforcement agencies.</em></p>

                            <h4>Where do I sign up for a training?</h4>
                            <p>Please fill out the volunteer form above and check the appropriate box, and we will notify you of upcoming legal observer trainings. You can also follow <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ohionlg/" target="_new">The Ohio Chapter of the NLG</a> on facebook to learn of upcoming Legal Observer trainings. </p>

                            <h4>How can I learn more now?</h4>
                            <p>Please read the following Legal Observer training manual. However, you will need to attend a full training and complete an application and confidentiality agreement before you are able to don the lime green NLG Legal Observer hat!</p>
