                    <h3>Do I have to call the NLG?</h3>
                    <p>Calling this number may be crucial as you may have information that can lead to a faster release. They can also help you locate your friend or family member and make sure that they are O.K.</p>
                    <h3>Should I tell people about my friend/family member possibly being arrested?</h3>
                    <p>Please use discretion here - making it publicly known by posting on twitter or facebook could cause employers, educators, etc to learn about their involvement in demonstrations and use this information against them.</p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong>Do not share information about what led to their arrest if you witnessed it or learned about it from them. This information is best shared discreetly with their lawyer.</p>
                    <h3>What should I tell the NLG?</h3>
                    <p>A professional will answer your call and help walk you through the questions that can help with their release. Again, if you know any details of what happened leading up to the arrest, please refrain from sharing this with the person on the line as this should only be shared with a lawyer in private.</p>
